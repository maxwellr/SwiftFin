# SwiftFin
Swift wrapper for free-to-use finance APIs


Example Project shows how to use the wrapper.

 It's works with NYSE, NASDAQ, OTC and TSE tickers. First two use IEX Trading API. Latter two use AlphaVantage API.

You have to change this line with your AlphaVantage key:
    let KEY = "YOUR_ALPHAVANTAGE_KEY"


For TSE tickers use .TO suffix.
For OTC tickers use .OTC suffix.
